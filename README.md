# Cra-Z-G-s-DVD-Megaplex

This program simulates a wholesale/retail environment that a movie rental store might experience. 

The options menu offers:
  a. The store can manually enter the movies into a "database" (information is on an included .txt file)
  b. The store or customer can see a selection of the store's available inventory
  c. The customer can go through the process of renting a certain number of movie titles
  d. The store or customer can quit the program.

A non-GUI program that uses a linked list to organize the movie titles by inventory ID. The user will see different
categories that display the movie ID, movie title, cost/day rental and a quick description of that movie.
